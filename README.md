# Query Movie React Project
welcome to the Query Movie React Project! This is a simple web application built using React that allows users to search for movies and view details about them using the JSON file (src/Films/Films.json) as database

In this project, I've embraced functional components and harnessed the power of React Hooks, including useState, useEffect, and Context. This approach has streamlined my development process and improved the overall readability and maintainability of my codebase.
